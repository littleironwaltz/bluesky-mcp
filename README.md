# Bluesky MCP (Model Context Protocol)

A Go service that implements a Model Context Protocol server for the Bluesky social network via the AT Protocol, enabling AI-powered features.

## Features

- **Feed Analysis**: Analyze Bluesky feeds and perform sentiment analysis on posts
- **Post Assistant**: Generate varied and engaging content suggestions for Bluesky posts based on mood and topic
- **Community Management**: Track user activity and monitor recent posts
- **Security**: Implements input validation, TLS security, and protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy features for increased reliability

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an API specification for integrating AI and ML models with the AT Protocol ecosystem. MCP servers provide context to applications, enabling them to leverage AI capabilities without requiring direct integration with large language models or other AI systems.

## Functionality Overview

### Feed Analysis

The Feed Analysis service provides insights into Bluesky posts by:

- Retrieving and analyzing posts from a user's feed or searching for posts with a specific hashtag
- Performing sentiment analysis to classify post tone (positive, negative, or neutral)
- Calculating metrics for each post (character count, word count)
- Implementing caching strategies for improved performance and reliability
- Processing posts in parallel for faster analysis of large datasets

### Post Assist

The Post Assist service helps users create engaging content by:

- Generating varied post suggestions based on user-specified mood and topic
- Offering multiple mood templates (happy, sad, excited, thoughtful) with natural variations
- Integrating topics with different phrasings to maintain diversity
- Randomizing template selection to prevent repetitive suggestions
- Sanitizing inputs to prevent XSS and other injection attacks

### Community Management

The Community Management service helps monitor user activity by:

- Retrieving a user's recent posts from their Bluesky author feed
- Filtering posts to only include those created within the last week
- Implementing caching to reduce API calls and improve response times
- Validating user handles with proper format checking
- Supporting both handle and DID-based user identification

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Bluesky account credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/littleironwaltz/bluesky-mcp.git
   cd bluesky-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Configure the service:
   
   Using environment variables:
   ```bash
   export BSKY_ID="your-bluesky-handle-or-email"
   export BSKY_PASSWORD="your-bluesky-password"
   export BSKY_HOST="https://bsky.social"  # Required for secure operation
   export BSKY_BACKUP_ID="backup-handle-or-email"  # Optional backup credentials
   export BSKY_BACKUP_PASSWORD="backup-password"   # Optional backup credentials
   ```
   
   Or using a JSON configuration file:
   ```bash
   export BSKY_CONFIG_FILE="/path/to/config.json"
   ```
   
   Example config.json:
   ```json
   {
     "BskyID": "your-bluesky-handle-or-email",
     "BskyPassword": "your-bluesky-password",
     "BskyHost": "https://bsky.social"
   }
   ```

### Building and Running the Service

```bash
# Build the server application
make build

# Run the server application
make run

# Or run the binary directly
./bin/bluesky-mcp
```

The service will start on port 3000 by default, with a health check server on port 3001.

## Running with MCP Inspector

Build and run the server with:
```
make build
make run
```

The server runs on port 3000. Connect MCP Inspector to http://localhost:3000/mcp/{method} endpoints.
